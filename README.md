Questions
1. What is your favorite test framework and why?
   I haven't had much experience using different testing frameworks so it is hard to say what my favorite would be. The built in unittest module in python seems easy to use and is the only testing framework I've worked with so far. I hope with this internship I'll learn more about other testing frameworks and software testing methodologies.

2. Given the following sample_account.py (see source code in repo), please write a unit test suite for the class.

3. Set up your unit test suite on github and travis CI.
